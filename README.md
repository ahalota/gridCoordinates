# gridCoordinates
Utility for converting lat-lng coordinates to gridded Equirectangular coordinates.

The current functionality is very basic and only works for 1/4 degree equirectangular coordinates. 

Future plans should include an input parameter for size of gridded coordinates, as well as options to set a different starting point for grid cell (0,0).
